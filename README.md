# counting_words
Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. Then, this program generates a random number between 0 and 1. Then, this program asks the user to enter a number between 0 and 1. If the random number generated is less than the number entered by the user, then the program counts the number of words in the sentence (entered by the user in the beginning) starting with the letter 'p'; else, the program counts the number of words in the sentence containing the string "pet". Ignore the case of the letters.

Here are two sample runs:

Sample 1:
Enter a sentence: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Enter a number between 0 and 1: 0.3
Number of words starting with "p" is: 6

Sample 2:
Enter a sentence: My petâ€™s appetite has reduced.
Enter a number between 0 and 1: 0.7
Number of words containing the string "pet" is: 2
